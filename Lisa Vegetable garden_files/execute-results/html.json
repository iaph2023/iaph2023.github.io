In this section I looked at the Lisa Vegetable Garden data set from tidytuesday. I aimed to explore the data set and create a visualization using the data.\n\n\nThe dataset used in this project, **Lisa's Vegetable Garden**, is sourced from [Tidy Tuesday's May 28, 2024 release](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-05-28/readme.md).\n\n\nThe Lisa's Vegetable Garden dataset contains detailed records of Lisa Lendway's vegetable garden from the summers of 2020 and 2021. The data includes planting, harvesting, and spending details, offering insights into gardening practices and changes between the two years. Originally used in her Introduction to Data Science course at Macalester College, the dataset provides a hands-on way to explore data science concepts.\n\nTidy Tuesday is a weekly R project encouraging data wrangling, visualization, and sharing insights with the #TidyTuesday community.\n\n\nHere is the dataset that I used:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 22)\n\nharvest_2020 <- tuesdata$harvest_2020\nharvest_2021 <- tuesdata$harvest_2021\nplanting_2020 <- tuesdata$planting_2020\nplanting_2021 <- tuesdata$planting_2021\nspending_2020 <- tuesdata$spending_2020\nspending_2021 <- tuesdata$spending_2021\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nHere is a quick glimpse of the data contained in the harvest_2020 dataset.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(harvest_2020,5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  vegetable variety          date       weight units\n  <chr>     <chr>            <date>      <dbl> <chr>\n1 lettuce   reseed           2020-06-06     20 grams\n2 radish    Garden Party Mix 2020-06-06     36 grams\n3 lettuce   reseed           2020-06-08     15 grams\n4 lettuce   reseed           2020-06-09     10 grams\n5 radish    Garden Party Mix 2020-06-11     67 grams\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis code chuck creates a new data set called harvest_2020_avg which I use in my visualization later. I find the average harvest weight across all months in the 2020 harvest season.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a new dataset with average harvest weight per month\nharvest_2020_avg <- harvest_2020 |>\n  # Add a new column 'month', extracting the year and month from the 'date' column\n  mutate(month = as.Date(format(as.Date(date), \"%Y-%m-01\"))) |> \n  # Group the data by the 'month' column\n  group_by(month) |>\n  # Calculate the average weight for each month, ignoring missing values (NA)\n  summarize(avg_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Display the resulting dataset\nharvest_2020_avg\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  month      avg_weight\n  <date>          <dbl>\n1 2020-06-01       78.8\n2 2020-07-01      219. \n3 2020-08-01      473. \n4 2020-09-01     1128. \n5 2020-10-01      959. \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBelow you can see my code and data visualization of Lisa's Vegetable Garden. The graph represents the average weight of vegetables harvested during each month of the 2020 harvest.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a line plot of average vegetable weights harvested per month\nggplot(harvest_2020_avg, aes(x = month, y = avg_weight)) +  # Set up ggplot with dataset and aesthetic mappings\n  geom_line() +  # Add a line connecting the average weights for each month\n  geom_point() +  # Add points at each month's average weight for emphasis\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Weight of Vegetables Harvested per Month in 2020 Season\",  # Set the plot title\n    x = \"Month\",  # Label for the x-axis (Month)\n    y = \"Average Weight (grams)\"  # Label for the y-axis (Average Weight in grams)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lisa-Vegetable-garden_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-alt='This line graph shows the average weight of vegetables harvested per month during the 2020 season.
